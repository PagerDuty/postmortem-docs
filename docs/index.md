Performing postmortems after incidents is how you learn what you're doing right, where you could improve, and most importantly, how to avoid making the same mistakes again and again. Well-designed postmortems allow your teams to iteratively improve your infrastructure and incident response process.

The postmortem concept is well known in the technology industry, but it can be difficult for newer individuals, teams, and organizations to adopt the cultural nuances required for effective postmortems. This guide will teach you how to build a culture of continuous learning, the most important components to include in your analysis, and how to conduct effective postmortem meetings.
